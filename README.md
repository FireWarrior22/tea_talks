Tea-Talks is a chat 💬 application where you can create rooms to chat 🗣️ and watch videos 📺 together. It has an in-app browser that is synced across all users to enjoy watching videos together. The chats are end-to-end ecnrypted. The backend is implemented using Firebase. 


PS: The sensitive contents are not added in the repository. They contain a password of length 32, stored by the developer, which is used in combination with the user provided password to generate a strong password combination, which is finally used for encryption.

Basically just to add a layer of security, in case the user password is very easy to guess.
